# Labanotation

This document is a brief description of what I have understood of the labanotation till now and consider relevant for others. It will be updated as I read further and understand more things.

Labanotation effectively captures the movement of a dancer in both space and time by describing a transition to an established point in space. One is supposed to read the notation from bottom to top as the progression of time is represented in the said direction.

The notation makes use of staff lines to separate the different aspects of the movement. The simplest staff would have just three lines and two columns - the left column representing the left support and the right column representing the right support. Support means the part of the body which "support" the center of the weight of the body (which usually are the feet).

More columns are added to both the left and the right sides to represent different parts of the body, other objects and props etc.

![Staff](img/staff.png)

The support columns represent the main movement of the body while other columns describe the decorative aspects of the dance. Let us first discuss what the various details of the notation in the context of support columns.

## Direction symbols
There are eight main directions (Left, Right, Forward, Backward, and everything in between)

![Direction symbols](img/direction_modifiers.png)

## Levels
Levels indicate how high the movement will be. The symbols are shaded according to the level they want to represent. There are three main levels - low, medium, high.

![Levels](img/levels.png)

![Levels with direction modifiers](img/levels2.png?raw=true)

## Place
The place symbol is a simple rectangle and represents the current position of the dancer. It moves with the dancer.

## Time
Time is a very important aspect of any dance notation. Time progresses vertically and the markings on the staff lines represent how steps are performed as time goes on.
An important music concept to keep in mind here is the time signature which dictates how the staff lines will be divided into "rows" of barlines.
Time Signature:
- The time signature of a musical notation indicate the rythm of the piece, that is, it indicates how many beats will be contained in each bar.
- Beats:
  - A beat is essentially just a basic unit of time. Multiple beats combine to form a rhythm and "notes" are played according to it.
  - The most common notes are:
    - quarter note (usually 1 beat)
    - half note (2 beats)
    - whole note (4 beats)
  - Note duration is described in the beginning of the piece in terms of a particular note, that is, which note will represent one beat. This note is usually the quarter note.
![Note duration](img/note_duration.jpg?raw=true)
- Time signature is denoted as follows: x/y where x and y are two numbers where y stands for which note represents one beat and x represents the number of beats in one measure.
- Here is how different values of y are interpreted:
  - 4 -> quarter note
  - 2 -> half note
  - 1 -> whole note
- If the time signature of a piece is 3/4, it simply means that one quarter note equals one beat and there are three beats in each measure.

- Bar lines are used to indicate measures.

Now that the musical aspect has been explained, the correspondance between the dance symbols can be understood easily. The length of any direction symbol describes how long the step (in place of note) will be held.

The length of the direction modifier indicates how long the step is going to be held. In the beginning of the piece, a correspondance between musical notes and modifier lengths can be drawn to describe the duration of the step.
Measure numbers are written to the left of the staff lines to count measures in the given piece.

![Direction symbols and their duration](img/note_symbol_relation.png?raw=true)

## Retention symbol 
The retention symbol is represented by **o** and  indicates that the dancer has to retain their current position and not deviate from it. Retention symbol's effect gets canceled when a certain step forces the center of the weight of the body to get transferred in a position that disallows the body to hold the said position.

## Legato versus staccato steps
Legato means smooth while staccato means separated. A sequence of continuous, unseparated steps that flow into each other form a legato movement while staccato movements are separated by breaks. In staccato movements, retention symbol is used to denote a pause in the current step (the dancer retains their position in the current position before moving to the next step).

### Legato example

![Legato example](img/legato.png?raw=true)

### Staccato example

![Staccato example](img/staccato.png?raw=true)

## Position pins
It is clear that direction symbols describe movement and motion but they do not give any clear indication about the position of the dancer's feet. Position pins are used to describe the position of one support (leg/foot in usual cases) with respect to the other support. Both supports cannot be together in all cases. There are two position pins which are used to describe this for each support. One is used to show when one leg is in front of the other while the other is used when one is behind the other.

![Position pins](img/pospins.png?raw=true)
![Feet position vs notation](img/pospins2.png?raw=true)

When a dancer moves from one position to another, it is not clear which leg made the active move. Position pins are used to describe that as well. So if both supports are active, both pins are used.
If this still remains unclear and you are enthusiastic about understanding the role of position pins, a good way to learn would be to skim through pages 53 to 57 of the Labanotation book by Ann Hutchinson.

## Caret symbol
The caret symbol is used to describe that the foot is going to remain in the same position in the next. So, instead of describing which foot takes the active role, caret symbol does just the opposite - it shows which foot does not move.
**Left caret:** ![Caret symbol for left](img/caret1.png?raw=true)
**Right caret:** ![Caret symbol for right](img/caret2.png?raw=true)

## Springing
Springing or aerial steps form an important part of any dance. Some dance forms include emphasised springs (major springs) while others have lighter, more tame ones (minor springs). Absence of symbols represents lack of movement. When there is a gap between two direction modifiers in the support columns, it represents a lack of support aka a spring. When you think about it, it also demonstrates the importance of retention symbol - a retention symbol "retains" the previous stance for a while. The absence of retention symbol means the previous stance is not to be retained and hence, the dancer dives into the air.
It may have already become clear that the length of the gap between two modifiers denotes "aerial time", that is, how long the dancer is going to stay in the air.

Since springs are represented by the absence of symbols, how will one describe their nature? How will you distinguish between high springs and low springs? The level of the direction modifiers before and after a spring along with their aerial time are sufficient indicators for that. A spring from one position to another gives a clear idea about how high it is supposed to be. For instance, a short spring between two middle level supports will (and should) not result in much of a vertical change. A spring written for a shorter duration will not leave enough time for a dancer to spring high in the air.

The support columns are mere indicators of a spring occuring. What the legs do in the air will be described in the columns for leg gestures.

There are different types of springs depending on how the dancer uses supports. These are:
1. Jumps - When the dancer is on both supports initially as well as after the spring.
2. Hops - When the dancer is on just one support initially as well as after the spring.
3. Leaps - When the dancer springs from one support to another.
4. Assemble - From one support to both supports.
5. Sissone - From both supports to one support.

![Types of springs](img/springs.png?raw=true)

## Turns
Turns or rotations form an important part of any dance. Turns can be either clockwise or counterclockwise and can be performed by just one specific body part individually or by the body as a whole. In Labanotation, turns are represented by slanting parallelograms with the direction being represented by the slanting lines of the symbol.

![Turns](img/turns.png?raw=true)

**Composite turn sign** - the composite turn sign could mean the following:
  - If written on the support column, it means the dancer could turn in either direction s(he) wishes to.
  - If written for specific parts of the body, it means the part is to be turned neither in nor out.

### Degree of turns
The amount of turn is denoted by the position pins. The interpretation of these pins changes according to the nature of the turn.

![Degree of turns](img/turn_degrees.png?raw=true)

![Turn degrees](img/degree_of_turns.png?raw=true)

Once a turn has been performed, the front changes and the interpretation of direction symbols also changes.

### Overlap between stepping and turning
One can step while turning but since teh notation has two separate symbols to represent these movements, the overlap is represented by a new symbol - *the simultaneous action bow*

![Simultaneous action bow](img/simultaneous_action_bow.png?raw=true)

The presence of bow means that even though two actions have been written one after the other, they are to be performed together.

### Levels of turns
Turns don't just have degrees but levels as well. **The turn is performed in the same level as the previous step.**
For instance,

![Turn levels](img/turn_levels.png?raw=true)

A turn could change levels during the process as well. To denote this, the turn symbol is shaded. Despite the shading, space is always left for the pin. Here is how a turn symbol is shaded to represent the change in levels:
  - Only the beginning of the symbol is shaded if the level changes at the beginning of the turn.
  - The end of the symbol is shaded to denote the change at the end of the turn.
  - The entire symbol is shaded (leaving space for the black pin in the middle) to denote a change in level throughout the turn.
  - Multiple changes in levels can be represented by shading multiple parts of the symbol.

Here are a few examples:
![Change in turn levels](img/levels_turns.png?raw=true)

#### Continuous turns
A turn that is continuous over a significant span of time and has different levels in many different places in time, one can either add a detailed analysis of the turn by shading each specific region of the symbol or could make use of the fact that continuous turns happen naturally. So, as opposed to the former approach, one can simply notate that a turn is going to happen, write level changes (using the place symbol), and let the dancer interpret the turn according to their natural motion.

An example:

![Continuous turn](img/continuous_turns.png?raw=true)

### Swivels
A swivel is a turn on both supports.

### Interwoven turns
A turn that either starts on two supports and ends on one or starts on one support and ends on one. Pins beside the symbol will indicate the position of one support with respect to the other foot.

![Interwoven turns](img/interwoven_turns.png?raw=true)

### Springing turns - turns in the air
A dancer can, quite possibly, turn unsupported. To represent this in labanotion, the turn sign is written across both support columns and accompanied by **action strokes**. Action lines can have special gestures as well.

![Action lines](img/action_lines.png?raw=true)

Another way to represent would be using leg gestures which will be discussed later.

## Front signs
To describe where the dancer needs to be *in the room or the defined area*, front signs are used.
The sign for area is a simple square which establishes the center of the room. Regardless of the shape of teh room, the center area will always be represented by a square. According to this center square, other directions fall automatically in place. Face signs are used to show how the dancer is facing with respect to the room.

![Front sign](img/front_sign.png?raw=true)

Through the square, a pair of axes is to be imagined according to which face directions will be decided. There will be an established front (the front direction will always point towards the established front). The image below gives a clearer idea (White pins represent female dancers and the point of the pin shows where she is facing):

![Established Front](img/established_front.png?raw=true)

### Constant cross of axes
The cross of axes that goes through the front symbol is constant and will not tilt. The cross symbol serves as a key to define the system of reference for the room. Each dancer also has an imaginary cross of axes going through them and the front direction always points *towards the established front*.
The cross of axes is constant for the dancers as well and will not turn with the dancer.

![Constant cross of axes](img/cross_of_axes.png?raw=true)

### Front signs and their use
Here are all eight front signs:

![Front directions](img/front_directions.png?raw=true)

The dancer can always turn to change their stance but there are instances where the change of front is more important than how the change was achieved. The dancer is free to achieve the result in the most natural way possible.
The following image has a front symbol before the double line (the starting position) which means "Face the back of the room". Later in the dance, the performer has to "face the front of the room" for which they will have to turn.
The following is an example of how change of front can be stated throughout the dance. Such notation takes away the intricate details of turning and makes for a quicker, more free approach.

![Changing fronts](img/changing_fronts.png?raw=true)

There will be instances where the nature of turn will also hold importance and in such cases, both the change of front and the turn should be specified in the notation.

**Front signs can take the place of black pins when no particular attention needs to be paid to the degree of turn but the final destination.**

![Turns with faces](img/turns_with_faces.png?raw=true)

## Focal Point
The directions can be specified with respect to a focal point as well. The focal point could be an apparatus, the performer's partner, center of the group and so on. Focal point is indicated by ![Focal point](img/focal_point.png?raw=true)

At the start of the score, the focal point for the dancer should be specified as follows:

![focal point specification](img/focal_point_spe.png?raw=true)

1. Focal points can be placed on the appropriate side/corner of a turn symbol to state the final destination of the performer.

![focal point with turns](img/focal_point_turns.png?raw=true)

2. In scores that use focal points, front signs cannot be used. Thus, descriptions need to be given in terms of orientation with respect to the focal point. To do so, a new notation called *meeting line* is introduced. Focal point is combined with the meeting line to indicate the relationship where the meeting line represents the performer. These indications are placed outside the score to the left.

![focal point with meeting line](img/meeting_line.png?raw=true)

**Space hold symbol:** ![space hold](img/space_hold.png?raw=true)
A turn and step amalgamation will transfer the center of weight of the body and change the direction the body is facing. A space hold symbol will indicate that the spatial direction in which the weight is being transferred should not be changed.

### A few more symbols
1. Angular release sign - Cancel the space hold sign. ![angular release](img/angular_Release.png?raw=true)
2. Ad libitum (Optional degree of turn) - Amount of turning is not fixed - the performer has freedom to choose. ![ad libitum](img/ad_libitum.png?raw=true)
3. Infinity - Perform as many turns as possible. ![infinity](img/infinity.png?raw=true)

## Arm gestures
The principal direction modifiers can be used in the column for arm gestures to denote their movement as a whole in a particular direction. There is no difference in their interpretation when compared to the support columns. The use of position pins also signifies the same thing for arms. The following examples show how:

![direction modifiers and arm gestures](img/dirm_with_arms.png?raw=true)

### Peripheral Paths
When the arm is moved from one point to another, the distance between both points can be described as degree distances. A peripheral movement is a movement in which the arm moves along the external boundary and describe a part of a circle.

1. First degree distance
There are eight main direction points in which the arm can move. Movement between two adjacent points will describe a first degree distance.

![first degree distance](img/first_degree_dist.png?raw=true)

2. Second degree distance
A second degree distance follows a quarter circle arc without any arm flexion. This movement also produces a peripheral path.

![second degree distance](img/second_degree_dist.png?raw=true)

In cases when the dancer has to follow a traversal path, the movement can be described with the straight path sign.

![transversal second degree distance](img/transversal_second_degree_dist.png?raw=true)

3. Third degree distance
A third degree distance will be covered by following a curved peripheral path, as shown below.

![third degree distance](img/third_degree_dist.png?raw=true)

4. Semicircular arm movements
Semi circular arm movements (movement from one opposite end to another) can occur in various ways. The following examples describe how they can be stated in the notation:

![semicircular arm movements](img/semi_circular_movements.png?raw=true)

### Central paths
In movements in which the extremity of the arm passes close to the body, that is, the shoulder (the center point of the arm), the path traced is called a central path.

#### Fourth degree distance
The build of the body allows the arm to move between two opposite ends by flexing the arm and following a central path. Here is an illustration showing the movement of arm from forward position to backward position.

![fourth degree](img/fourth_degree.png?raw=true)

### Timings
The length of the symbol describes the amount of time required to reach the destination.

#### Legato
A series of continuous movements.

![legato arm movement](img/legato_arm.png?raw=true)

#### Staccato
A gap between two direction symbols describes a pause. Here are a few illustrations of how gaps differ from legato to staccatissimo.

![stacato arm movement](img/staccato_arm.png?raw=true)

#### Change of levels
Change of levels within one symbol can be notated in various ways. Here are three ways to represent the same changes:

![change levels arm](img/change_levels_arm.png?raw=true)

The above examples have level changes placed at identical timings when in fact, these changes could be variable (with respect to time). The length of shading on the symbol will denote how fast the level shift will happen.

![variable timing levels](img/variation_timing_level_arm.png?raw=true)

Using one symbol and shading its separate regions to indicate change in levels instead of repeating fully shaded symbols emphasises the smoothness of the movement since there are no gaps to consider at all. For instance, even though both the notations represent the same movement, the relative length of shading notate the action much more clearly.

![two vs one symbol](img/two_vs_one_levels.png?raw=true)

#### Phrasing bow
Smooth transitions between symbols are emphasised by the phrasing bow. The small gaps in usual legato transitions indicate tiny breaks. Phrasing bow emphasises the smoothness of the movement.

![phrasing bow](img/phrasing_bow.png?raw=truw)

#### Facing direction of palms
The unwritten or default facing direction of palms is towards the body when arms are on the side. In cases where arms cross each other, they face the logical intermediate direction.
To describe the palm facing and gestures with more precision, the symbol for palm is used. This is the symbol for palm: ![palm](img/palm.png?raw=true)

Palm symbol does not always describe the instruction well and is usually replaced with thumb edge symbol to describe a clearer orientation.
Left thumb edge: ![left thumb](img/left_thumb.png?raw=true)
Right thumb edge: ![right thumb](img/right_thumb.png?raw=true)

Palm and thumb edge symbols are placed on the outer side of the arm gestures columns. Direction symbols are used to specify the palm and thumb positions. Here are a few examples:

![palm and thumbs](img/palms_thumbs.png?raw=true)

**A palm or thumb instruction is only valid if the arm gesture written next to it is valid. The notation cannot have palm and thumb edge facing directions without specifying arm gestures**

Body hold or space hold signs can be used to retain a palm facing gesture.

- Cancellation sign - ![palm cancellation sign](img/palm_cancel.png?raw=true)
- Return to normal sign - ![return to normal](img/return_to_normal.png?raw=true)

#### The use of space retention symbol in arm gestures columns
Space hold symbol means that the limb needs to retain a previously established direction in the room even when the body turns away from it. The space hold lasts till the turn lasts. If it further needs to be in effect, it will have to be repeated.


## Leg gestures
Direction symbols show the position of the leg from the center line. So a low backward direction symbol will denote that the leg is behind the center line and in low level.

![leg gestures - direction modifiers and their meaning](img/leg_gestures.png?raw=true)

### Retention symbol
Absence of any symbol from the support column represents a spring so a retention symbol in any of the support columns will tell which leg will provide support to the body. The column which will not have a retention symbol will be free to perform any leg gesture.

![retention symbol and leg gestures](img/retention_symbol_leg_gestures.png?raw=true)

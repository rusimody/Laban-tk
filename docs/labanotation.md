# Labanotation

This document is a brief description of what I have understood of the labanotation till now and consider relevant for others. It will be updated as I read further and understand more things.

Labanotation effectively captures the movement of a dancer in both space and time by describing a transition to an established point in space. One is supposed to read the notation from bottom to top as the progression of time is represented in the said direction.

The notation makes use of staff lines to separate the different aspects of the movement. The simplest staff would have just three lines and two columns - the left column representing the left support and the right column representing the right support. Support means the part of the body which "support" the center of the weight of the body (which usually are the feet).

More columns are added to both the left and the right sides to represent different parts of the body, other objects and props etc.

The support columns represent the main movement of the body while other columns describe the decorative aspects of the dance. Let us first discuss what the various details of the notation in the context of support columns.

## Direction symbols
There are eight main directions (Left, Right, Forward, Backward, and everything in between)

## Levels
Levels indicate how high the movement will be. The symbols are shaded according to the level they want to represent. There are three main levels - low, medium, high.

## Place
The place symbol is a simple rectangle and represents the current position of the dancer. It moves with the dancer.

## Time
Time is a very important aspect of any dance notation. Time progresses vertically and the markings on the staff lines represent how steps are performed as time goes on.
An important music concept to keep in mind here is the time signature which dictates how the staff lines will be divided into "rows" of barlines.
Time Signature:
- The time signature of a musical notation indicate the rythm of the piece, that is, it indicates how many beats will be contained in each bar.
- Beats:
  - A beat is essentially just a basic unit of time. Multiple beats combine to form a rhythm and "notes" are played according to it.
  - The most common notes are:
   - quarter note (usually 1 beat)
   - half note (2 beats)
   - whole note (4 beats)
  - Note duration is described in the beginning of the piece in terms of a particular note, that is, which note will represent one beat. This note is usually the quarter note.
![Note duration](https://github.com/rusimody/Laban-tk/blob/pucsd_laban_project/docs/img/note_duration.jpg?raw=true)
- Time signature is denoted as follows: x/y where x and y are two numbers where y stands for which note represents one beat and x represents the number of beats in one measure.
- Here is how different values of y are interpreted:
  - 4 -> quarter note
  - 2 -> half note
  - 1 -> whole note
- If the time signature of a piece is 3/4, it simply means that one quarter note equals one beat and there are three beats in each measure.

- Bar lines are used to indicate measures.

Now that the musical aspect has been explained, the correspondance between the dance symbols can be understood easily. The length of any direction symbol describes how long the step (in place of note) will be held.

The length of the direction modifier indicates how long the step is going to be held. In the beginning of the piece, a correspondance between musical notes and modifier lengths can be drawn to describe the duration of the step.
Measure numbers are written to the left of the staff lines to count measures in the given piece.

## Retention symbol 
The retention symbol is represented by **o** and  indicates that the dancer has to retain their current position and not deviate from it. Retention symbol's effect gets canceled when a certain step forces the center of the weight of the body to get transferred in a position that disallows the body to hold the said position.

## Legato versus staccato steps
Legato means smooth while staccato means separated. A sequence of continuous, unseparated steps that flow into each other form a legato movement while staccato movements are separated by breaks. In staccato movements, retention symbol is used to denote a pause in the current step (the dancer retains their position in the current position before moving to the next step).

## Position pins
It is clear that direction symbols describe movement and motion but they do not give any clear indication about the position of the dancer's feet. Position pins are used to describe the position of one support (leg/foot in usual cases) with respect to the other support. Both supports cannot be together in all cases. There are two position pins which are used to describe this for each support. One is used to show when one leg is in front of the other while the other is used when one is behind the other.

When a dancer moves from one position to another, it is not clear which leg made the active move. Position pins are used to describe that as well.
If this still remains unclear and you are enthusiastic about understanding the role of position pins, a good way to learn would be to skim through pages 53 to 57 of the Labanotation book by Ann Hutchinson.

## Caret symbol
The caret symbol is used to describe that the foot is going to remain in the same position in the next. So, instead of describing which foot takes the active role, caret symbol does just the opposite - it shows which foot does not move.

## Springing
Springing or aerial steps form an important part of any dance. Some dance forms include emphasised springs (major springs) while others have lighter, more tame ones (minor springs). Absence of symbols represents lack of movement. When there is a gap between two direction modifiers in the support columns, it represents a lack of support aka a spring. When you think about it, it also demonstrates the importance of retention symbol - a retention symbol "retains" the previous stance for a while. The absence of retention symbol means the previous stance is not to be retained and hence, the dancer dives into the air.
It may have already become clear that the length of the gap between two modifiers denotes "aerial time", that is, how long the dancer is going to stay in the air.

Since springs are represented by the absence of symbols, how will one describe their nature? How will you distinguish between high springs and low springs? The level of the direction modifiers before and after a spring along with their aerial time are sufficient indicators for that. A spring from one position to another gives a clear idea about how high it is supposed to be. For instance, a short spring between two middle level supports will (and should) not result in much of a vertical change. A spring written for a shorter duration will not leave enough time for a dancer to spring high in the air.

The support columns are mere indicators of a spring occuring. What the legs do in the air will be described in the columns for leg gestures.

There are different types of springs depending on how the dancer uses supports. These are:
1. Jumps - When the dancer is on both supports initially as well as after the spring.
2. Hops - When the dancer is on just one support initially as well as after the spring.
3. Leaps - When the dancer springs from one support to another.
4. Assemble - From one support to both supports.
5. Sissone - From both supports to one support.
